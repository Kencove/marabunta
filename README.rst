Marabunta is used to provide an easy way to provide updates to Odoo which can be created fast and run easily. It also allows to differentiate between different environment to provide for instance demodata.


Usage
=====
After installing marabunta will be available as a console command. To run properly it requires a migration file, which defines what should be updated/executed, and of course stuff like database pw. Most of these also can also be provided by an envvar and will be discussed in the options section.

It is very much recomended to configure it, so that marabunta is ran automatically if odoo is started.
For instance adding it to your docker entrypoint.

Features
========

* backup: Marabunta allows for a backup command to be executed before the migration.
* addon upgrades: Marabunta is able to install or upgrade odoo addons.
* addon uninstall: Addons which were previously installed can be removed with marabunta.
* operations: Allows to execute commands before or after upgrading modules.
* modes: Modes allow the user to execute commands only on a certain environment. i.e. creation of demodata on a dev system.

Versioning systems
------------------
Currently Marabunta allows for two different Versioning systems:
The classic Major.Minor.Bugfix and the Five digits long versions for OdooMajor.OdooMinor.Major.Minor.Bugfix.
Although the first marabunta version should always be called setup. This is a standin for all the versions till the release, to make it easier to keep marabunta versions and tags in sync.

YAML layout & Example
=====================
Here is an Example migration file::
    migration:
      options:
        # This includes general options which are used everytime marabunta is called.
        # --workers=0 --stop-after-init are automatically added
        install_command: odoo #Command which starts odoo
        install_args: --log-level=debug # additional Arguments
        backup: # Defines how the backup should be done before the migration.
          command: echo "backup command on ${DB_NAME}"
          stop_on_failure: true
          ignore_if: test "${RUNNING_ENV}" != "prod"
      versions:
        - version: setup # Setup is always the initia. version<
          operations:
            pre:  # executed before 'addons'
              - echo 'pre-operation'
            post:  # executed after 'addons'
              - anthem songs::install
          addons:
            upgrade:  # executed as odoo --stop-after-init -i/-u ...
              - base
              - document
            # remove:  # uninstalled with a python script
          modes:
            prod:
              operations:
                pre:
                  - echo 'pre-operation executed only when the mode is prod'
                post:
                  - anthem songs::load_production_data
            demo:
              operations:
                post:
                  - anthem songs::load_demo_data
              addons:
                upgrade:
                  - demo_addon

        - version: 0.0.2
          backup: false
          # nothing to do this can be used to keep marabunta and gittag in sync

        - version: 0.0.3
          operations:
            pre: # we also can execute os commands
              - echo 'foobar'
              - ls
              - bin/script_test.sh
            post:
              - echo 'post-op'

        - version: 0.0.4
          backup: false
          addons:
            upgrade:
              - popeye


Run the tests
-------------

To run ``marabunta`` tests, it is a good idea to do an *editable*
install of it in a virtualenv, and then intall and run ``pytest`` as
follows::

  $ git clone https://github.com/camptocamp/marabunta.git
  Cloning into 'marabunta'...
  $ cd marabunta
  $ virtualenv -p YOUR_PYTHON env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  $ pip install '.[test]'
  $ py.test tests
